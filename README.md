# CVTranformer_traffic_vit
This project implements a Convolutional Vision Transformer (CvT) for semantic segmentation on urban traffic scenes using the Cityscapes dataset. The CvT model combines convolutional layers and transformer blocks to capture both local and global features, making it well-suited for complex scene segmentation tasks required in autonomous driving.
